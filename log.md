# Chapter 2. 

## === Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Alt-coins ====

### 1) ------- What are Cryptocurrencies? -------

Cryptocurrency not only operates independently of a central bank but also is a digital currency using cryptography to accomplish 2 results:

- Create new coins

- Keep secure all the transactions

As it decentralized the banking system, You can use cryptocurency
to buy goods and services (it came in 2008 after the financial crisis)

As the driving force, Cryptocurrency belongs to anyone who is willing to use it.

#### Optimistic people see lots of advantages:

- No government (to regulate)

- No central bank (control)

- No middle man (to make profit)

### 2) -------- Why Bitcoin? ---------

Bitcoin has been the first cryptocurrency since the begining not only having
many advantages but also contributing to its popularity.

### 3) -------- How Bitcoin transactions work? ---------

Bitcoin transactions work with a wallet (digtal file containing your public
key = username & private key = like a password)

- In a transaction, seller shows his/her public address to access Bitcoin.

- The public key is not human readble but it is like a hash-based.

- A QR code that you can scan is also available.

#### => Simply put, public key is to bank account number what private key is to PIN.

### <----- Blockchain / How Bitcoin transactions work? ------>

Behind all transactions there is a technoogy called 'Blockchain' acting like
a general/public ledger.

- The reason transactions take 10-20 minutes because they are cryptographically protected (with others made in the same period by miners)

- Miners are very powerful computers that not only record and approve
transactions but also get small fees for their work.

### 4) -------- Main Disadvantages of Bitcoin  ---------

1. Bitcoin is not anonymous (every one can see your transactions in the
   blockckain meaning 2 public keys eventhough the can be changed later on )

2. Fees are high; (they use a Satoshi = 0.00000001 Bitcoin)
    For more info (www.bitcoinfees.earn.com)

3. 20 minutes to complete a Bitcoin transaction (suitable for online shopping)
   Ethereum fee is less than 1 minute and $1 comapred to $3.84 for Bitcoin.

- You can invest in a cryptocurrency solving problems that Bitcoin has.

### 6) -------- Alternative coins ---------

An alt-coin is abbreviated to "alternative to Bitcoin."

### 7) -------- How people become millionaires with these altcoins ---------

- Monero        in 2015 worth $0.36  and in 2017 worth $153.31 => x426 (11/2 year)

- Ethereum      in 2016 worth $6.13 and in 2017 worth $414.76 => x68 (6 months)

- NEM           in 2015 worth $0.000079 and 2017 worth $0.35 => x4430 (2 years)

- Ripple        in 3/2017 worth $0.0054 and in 5/2017 worth $0.43 => x80 (2 months)

- Digibyte      in 3/2017 worth $0.002 and in 6/2017 worth $0.0652 => x326 (3 months)

#### => A return of 1000% or more is possible in cryptocurrencies (on bright side)

#### => There are/were some cryptocurrencies that don't work properly (pitfalls)

### 8) -------- How to understand the value of an altcoin ---------

What altcoins should you buy?

1. Those that are always present (quoted) in many major exchanges (1 exchange not ok)

2. Altcoins with valid projects (with technical and viable  solutions)

3. Is it a trustworthy company? (Are they copules of students or profesionals?) meaning people who just want to buy Ferrari for themselves....

4. Altcoins with an active team in the community (twitter, feedback, updates)

#### The difference between coin and token is as followed:

#### - A 'coin' is a cryptocurrency operating independently.

#### - A 'token' is a cryptocurrency depending on another cryptocurrency as a platform to operate.
<!--
### What is the Market Capitalization?

Let's first understand the formula:
#### Market cap = price x circulating supply
- Bitcoin has a market cap of 200 B
- ICONIC has a market cap of 37 K (easier to calculate)
which one is more volatile in terms of huge investment?
of course, Iconic (with huge gains & losses)
Market cap is suitable for long term investment 
### The market cap is important because it is associated to the level of risk taking by the investor.

### The bigger the market cap, the lower the risk
### The smaller the market cap, the higher the risk (especially when dropping 50% or more)

### Circulating Supply vs Total Supply
