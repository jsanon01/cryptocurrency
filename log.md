Chapter 2. ============== Cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Alt-coins =================

1) ------- What are Cryptocurrencies? -------

Cryptocurrency not only operates independently of a central bank but also is
a digital currency using cryptography to accomplish 2 results:
- Create new coins
- Keep secure all the transactions
As it decentralized the banking system, You can use cryptocurency
to buy goods and services (it came in 2008 after the financial crisis)

As the driving force, Cryptocurrency belongs to anyone who is willing to use it.

Optimistic people see lots of advantages:
- no government (to regulate)
- no central bank (control)
- no middle man (to make profit)

2) -------- Why Bitcoin? ---------

Bitcoin has been the first cryptocurrency since the begining not only having
many advantages but also contributing to its popularity.

3) -------- How Bitcoin transactions work? ---------

Bitcoin transactions work with a wallet (digtal file containing your public
key = username & private key = like a password)
- In a transaction, seller shows his/her public address to access Bitcoin.
- The public key is not human readble but it is like a hash-based
- A QR code that you can scan is also available
=> Simply put, public key is to bank account number what private key is to PIN.

<-------- Blockchain / How Bitcoinn transactions work? --------->

Behind all transactions there is a technoogy called 'Blockchain' acting like
a general/public ledger.

- The reason transactions take 10-20 minutes because they are cryptographically
protected (with others made in the same period by miners)

- Miners are very powerful computers that not only record and approve
transactions but also get small fees for their work.

4) -------- Main Disadvantages of Bitcoin  ---------

1. Bitcoin is not anonymous (every one can see your transactions in the
   blockckain meaning 2 public keys eventhough the can be changed later on )
2. Fees are high; (they use a Satoshi = 0.00000001 Bitcoin)
